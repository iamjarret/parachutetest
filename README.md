### Overview

Parachutetest is an integration testing framework for
[FronTierCpp](https://github.com/b2tine/FronTierCpp) and FronTierCpp is a computational fluid dynamics tool for simulating, amongst other things, fluid/porous media interactions.

Developers and researchers can test their changes to the codebase.  Besides the purely utilitarian motive, automated testing with a database backend allows the research team to collect images and datasets of *failed* simulations.

This is its own research direction because in fine-tuning the application we are developing heuristics to determine how and when computational fluid simulations go awry.  We hope to implement these heuristics into the simulation model itself, i.e. in informed adaptive timestepping.

We welcome ideas and contributions!
